H: Whattaya wanna do?  I was thinking maybe an interpreted/encrypted FS.
H: Layed the groundwork for an FS (cFS for crypto-filesystem).  We could always do something more interesting, though.  I really don't care about scrapping it.
O: I think that we could start with a fil system and then if we get bored, we can always move on to something else.
H: sounds good.  which languages are you familiar with?  I'm doing it in C so far, but we could definitely write the API in another language.
